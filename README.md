# Uno Project

## Directions

You will be submitting your project to me via GitHub. Your repository!
 needs to include a *README* file (that's me!) that explains how to compile and run your program. Your report as a PDF document must also be included in your repository. This submission needs to happen by the end of the final exam period for our course. For us, that occurs on **Monday (12/19) @ 11:20am**.

This *README* file is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). If you're unfamiliar with this notation, [check out this guide](https://itsfoss.com/markdown-guide/).

Make sure to adhere to the full requirements as stated on [Canvas](https://clpccd.instructure.com/courses/30891/pages/final-project).

## Instructions for Professor

**TODO**


If you have played Uno before, this should be somewhat easy to understand, but if not there is some brief Rules explained within the program. Most of the program's user interface will consist of menus. Each menu will list the options with the the number to select them to the left. When entering Values make sure to read the prompts to allow the program to run as smooth as possible.

There are a few options on the first main menu but the main one is, of course, Play. For those who do not know how to play the game I suggest selecting the rules option first then coming back to play. Once you select this option you will be asked how many COM players you would like, these are Player objects who will be your opponents, or opponent if you select only 1. Every time it is your turn you will have your hand displayed to you, the cards are always read in this format "Color-value," and will be numbered for selection if you decide to play a card. Similarly to the main menu, the cards are numbered and read out, if you are playing a card the program will ask "Enter the card number you would like to play:" this refers to the numbers along the left side which count off each card, not the number values on the card itself. Just like in normal Uno you need to match the color, match the value, or use a black card to play a card. The program also runs a standard 108 card deck consisting: BLACK, RED, BLUE, YELLOW, and GREEN for colors as well as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, REVERSE,SKIP, +2, +4, and WILD for values.

However, playing a card is not the only move possible. If you have no possible card to play you can always draw a card and pass your turn. Even if you can play a card the option to draw still remains. You may also chose to sort your hand by color, or select the fourth option of a forfeit during your turns if you need to. The COM players are not too advanced so the game itself should not be difficult at all, just based on luck for the most part. When someone is close to winning (If they have 1 card left) there will be a message in the console, where the user who has reached Uno will exlaim it, this will come in the format "Player: UNO!" The games do not take very long usually but if you want to play again you will be sent back to the Main menu after a game. You can also quit on any of your turns if you really need to as well as exit from the main menu by pressing 4 when prompted.
