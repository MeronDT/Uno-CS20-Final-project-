# Final Project

## Directions

You will be submitting your project to me via GitHub. Your repository needs to include a *README* file (that's me!) that explains how to compile and run your program. Your report as a PDF document must also be included in your repository. This submission needs to happen by the end of the final exam period for our course. For us, that occurs on **Monday (12/19) @ 11:20am**.

This *README* file is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). If you're unfamiliar with this notation, [check out this guide](https://itsfoss.com/markdown-guide/).

Make sure to adhere to the full requirements as stated on [Canvas](https://clpccd.instructure.com/courses/30891/pages/final-project).
